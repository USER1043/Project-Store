# MERN Product Catalog App

This is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN Stack** – MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js – with **Chakra UI** for styling. It’s a simple product catalog system where you can:

- Add new products through a separate page
- View all products on the homepage
- Edit or delete products directly from the homepage

Each product includes an image shown using a URL string provided during creation.

The app was built by following a [freeCodeCamp.org](https://youtu.be/O3BUHwfHf84?si=d0YhOIGWNtFlTaCl) tutorial video, with explanations and guidance from [CodeSistency](https://www.youtube.com/@codesistency).
